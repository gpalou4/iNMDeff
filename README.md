**Background**
Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a quality-control pathway that degrades mRNA bearing premature termination codons (PTCs) resulting from mutation or mis-splicing, and that additionally participates in gene regulation of unmutated transcripts. While NMD activity is known to differ between examples of PTCs, it is less well studied if human tissues differ in NMD activity, or if individuals differ.

**Results**
We analyzed exomes and matched transcriptomes from human tumors and healthy tissues to quantify individual-level NMD efficiency, and assess its variability between tissues, tumors and individuals. This was done by monitoring mRNA levels of endogenous NMD target transcripts, and additionally supported by allele-specific expression of germline PTCs. Nervous system and reproductive system tissues have lower NMD efficiency than other tissues, such as the digestive tract. Next, there is systematic inter-individual variability in NMD efficiency, and we identify two underlying mechanisms. First, somatic copy number alterations can robustly associate with NMD efficiency, prominently the commonly-occurring gain at chromosome 1q that encompasses two core NMD genes: SMG5 and SMG7 and additional functionally interacting genes such as PMF1 and GON4L. Second, deleterious germline variants in genes such as the KDM6B chromatin modifier can associate with higher or lower NMD efficiency in individuals.
Variable NMD efficiency modulates positive selection upon somatic nonsense mutations in tumor suppressor genes, and is associated with cancer patient survival and immunotherapy responses.

**Conclusions** 
NMD efficiency is variable across human tissues, and it is additionally variable across individuals and tumors thereof due to germline and somatic genetic alterations.
